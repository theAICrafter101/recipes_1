List of my favourite recipes, I am desperately craving for!

## Purpose
• Building HTML foundational skills leading towards creating the website layout.
• Developing basic Git & GitHub skills, that helps in manage the different versions of the projects.

## Description
I built a simple website using only HTML. The project gives an understanding of using different tags, attributes, and elements of HTML. The wesbite contains the list of my favorite recipes. Later in future, I will add some CSS to make the website more asthetic and engaging.
