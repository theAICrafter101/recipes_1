# recipes_1

- This project is part of my journey on the odin project. This will help me become a better software developer, and a web developer specifically. My goal with this project is to learn the structure of CSS and using JS as a server side codebase. This project is part of that journey.
- For this project, I demonstrated my newfound knowledge of HTML basics by creating a website with two different recipes. I learned the HTML boilerplate, how to integrate links and images, unordered and ordered lists, etc.

- A list of my favorite recipes.

Purpose

Description
